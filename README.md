## 1. Sliding window
  
  The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list. Sliding Windows start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according to the problem that you are solving. In some cases, the window size remains constant and in other cases the sizes grows or shrinks.
  
  Used when:
  The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
  You’re asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value
  Common problems you use the sliding window pattern with:
  
  1. Maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
  2. Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
  3. String anagrams (hard)

## 2. Two pointer

  Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition.Two Pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list

  Used when:
  It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
  The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray
  Here are some problems that feature the Two Pointer pattern:
  1. Squaring a sorted array (easy)
  2. Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
  3. Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)

## 3. Modified Binary Search
  
  Whenever you are given a sorted array, linked list, or matrix, and are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm you can use is the Binary Search. This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search.

## 4. Dynamic Programming
  
  About 25% of all SRM problems have the "Dynamic Programming" category tag. The DP problems are popular among problemsetters because each DP problem is original in some sense and you have to think hard to invent the solution for it. Since dynamic programming is so popular, it is perhaps the most important method to master in algorithm competitions.
